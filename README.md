# Advent of code

Please enjoy my solutions to the 2021 advent of code!

the follow repository is a public example of my learnings using rust for some general programming problems. I can assure you my solutions are not optimal, nor will they particularly good examples of clean code.

My goal with this repository is to practice rust fundamentals, try some new programming tricks, practice programming fundamentals such as buffers, multi-threading, generics programming algorithms, etc,. you will find an eclectic mix of approaches to problem solving, and more complex solutions as time goes on and my understanding of rust improves.
